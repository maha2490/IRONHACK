			<h1>Hi.</h1>

			<p>This is the area where I will put my text and photo. Here's a list of colors I like:
				<ul>
					<li>dusty rose [super in right now] and the color of this background.</li>
					<li>turquioise</li>
					<li>gray. as in all shades.</li>
				</ul>
				I have many interests. One of my very favorites is food. Who has time to eat like a bird? These are a few dishes that come to mind. Set in a nice little chart.
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><th>favorite food</th><th>type</th><th>healthy</th></tr>

				<tbody>
					<tr><td>red velvet cake</td><td>dessert</td><td>NO</td></tr>
					<tr><td>pizza</td><td>entree</td><td>kind of</td></tr>
					<tr><td>lettuce wraps</td><td>snack</td><td>YES</td></tr>
				</tbody>
